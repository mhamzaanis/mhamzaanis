# Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

I'm Muhammad Hamza Anis, a driven developer with a deep passion for **Data Structures and Algorithms**, crafting efficient and scalable solutions. I’ve built **REST APIs** using **Java Spring Boot** for projects like a car rental system and designed intuitive GUI in Java Swing. Currently, I’m diving into the **MERN stack** to create dynamic, full-stack web applications, while exploring **AI and Machine Learning** to solve real-world problems through data-driven models. Explore my repositories to see my journey in coding, from optimized algorithms to innovative web and AI projects!

## 🌟 My Journey in AI & Machine Learning
My fascination with **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** stems from their power to transform industries like finance, real estate, and marketing. I’ve delved into **linear regression** models, implementing gradient descent to predict housing prices using Python and NumPy, and explored vectorized operations for multi-feature datasets (e.g., house size, bedrooms, floors, age). My work with Stanford’s AI/ML course labs has deepened my understanding of cost functions, gradient descent, and data visualization with Matplotlib, bridging my Java/C++ expertise with Python’s ML ecosystem. I’m excited to continue building intelligent systems, from predictive models to neural networks, to solve complex challenges.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To
- 🔍 **Mastering DSA**: Grinding LeetCode with algorithms like BFS, Dijkstra’s, and dynamic programming in Java and C++.
- 🌱 **Learning MERN**: Developing full-stack apps with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js for seamless user experiences.
- 💻 **Backend Expertise**: Built REST APIs with Java Spring Boot, including a car rental system API with MySQL integration.
- 🖥️ **GUI Development**: Created Java Swing applications like an inventory management system and a cafeteria login system for Café Connect.
